# Regenerate all Verify scenario baselines inside the deterministic
# linux/amd64 container.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   1. Confirms the user is on a clean git working tree (refuses otherwise —
#      a baseline reset must be its own commit).
#   2. Deletes every *.verified.* Verify snapshot under src/Tests/ — the Skia and
#      ImageSharp scenario page PNGs/JSON and export snapshots under Inputs/, plus the
#      spec-test and sample snapshots that live alongside the test sources. Build output
#      (bin/, obj/) is skipped, as are the expected_*.png Word references (no .verified.
#      infix).
#   3. Runs the test suite via scripts/test.sh — every scenario fails because
#      .verified.* is missing, producing .received.* files.
#   4. Promotes every *.received.* to *.verified.* in place.
#   5. Runs the suite a second time to confirm everything now passes.
#
# Use this only when a rendering change is intentional and the diff has
# been reviewed visually. The result is a large binary commit; review
# carefully.
